# [Resume](https://christofbecu.github.io/resume-project/) of Christof Becu

Based on [my resume](https://registry.jsonresume.org/ChristofBecu) made with [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/). I started this project to have more control over what and how the data is shown.

The theme in this project is based on [Kendall](https://github.com/LinuxBozo/jsonresume-theme-kendall) by [LinuxBozo](https://github.com/LinuxBozo)
